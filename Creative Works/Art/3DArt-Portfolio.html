      <h2><a id="SUS">Sustained Investigation</a></h2>
        <h3>Inquiry</h3>
        <p>How can I combine manufacturing and art? I have a long history of combining STEM and the humanities; during this project I wanted to incorporate both to create a beautiful end product. By changing the manufacturing steps, I could reach my artistic vision. At the beginning, the question was, "How can I design a chess set that is uniform, visually balanced, and pleasant to play with?" Further on, the question became, "What can I change in my code to best fabricate my design?" Throughout, I aimed to combine the sciences (psych, manu, ...) with the fundementals of art (form, texture, color, etc.)</p>
        <h3>Development through Practice, Experimentation, and Revision</h3>
        <p>I had to fix the code whenever the machine erred. The kings' hats broke (image 7); the lathe tools shook when cutting the rooks' heads (img. 8), the pawns slid and created an offset (img. 9). Most often, the solution was the cut slower/shallower. The knight (imgs. 12-13) had the most evolution: a) First try had a large offset. b) I tried to smooth the transition with deeper cuts, which I used in the end, but first I had to c) fix the offset. d) I tried adding detail by sharpening the muzzle, and e) switched to a round tool (img. 11) to reduce sharp angles. Finally, I f) fixed a tool problem.</p>
        <h3>Image 1</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 1.png">
        <p>Initial design. Unified all with the same base, and the knight, bishop, rook with the same height.</p>
        <h3>Image 2</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 2.png">
        <p>Haas ST10. Learning how the lathe works. Over time, I learned its sounds, rhythms, etc., which helped me catch errors.</p>
        <h3>Image 3</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 3.png">
        <p>Fusion 360. Final designs (sans knight). Used circles to get the side-curves. Adjusted bishop and rooks' thickness.</p>
        <h3>Image 4</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 4.png">
        <p>Fusion 360. Smoothing the sharp edges to protect chess players' fingers; scultping the knight.</p>
        <h3>Image 5</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 5.png">
        <p>Fusion 360. Coding each part. Most revisions were changing cutting speeds or tools.</p>
        <h3>Image 6</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 6.png">
        <p>Re-calibrating tool setup after discovering issues.</p>
        <h3>Image 7</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 7.png">
        <p>Each is 3.5 in tall with a diameter of 1.5 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted the code to prevent chipping.</p>
        <h3>Image 8</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 8.png">
        <p>Each is 2.25 in tall with a diameter of 1 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted the code and position of "stock" (aka unfinished material) to increase consistency.</p>
        <h3>Image 9</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 9.png">
        <p>Each is 2.75 in tall with a diameter of 1.25 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted code and position of stock to prevent the rough texture of "chatter" (when the tool shakes as it cuts)</p>
        <h3>Image 10</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 10.png">
        <p>Each is 2.75 in tall with a diameter of 1.25 in, made of aluminum. I selected pieces with the most uniformity (especially in the bases and tops) (uniform on the right)</p>
        <h3>Image 11</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 11.png">
        <p>Fusion 360. "Live tooling" to get the profile. Switched to a rounded drill to allow curved edges.</p>
        <h3>Image 12 and 13</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 12.png">
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 13.png">
        <p>Each is 2.75 in tall with a diameter of 1.25 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted machine offsets until the halves met, then added details.</p>
        <h3>Image 14 and 15</h3>
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 14.png">
        <img src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 15.png">
        <p>Total height: 4.13 in. Total width/depth: 19 in. Materials: aluminum, acrylic paint, felt, and a wooden chess board. I painted one half of the set black and added felt feet.</p>
