      <h2><a id="SUS">Sustained Investigation</a></h2>
        <h3>Inquiry</h3>
        <p>How can I combine manufacturing and art? I have a long history of combining STEM and the humanities; during this project I wanted to incorporate both to create a beautiful end product. By changing the manufacturing steps, I could reach my artistic vision. At the beginning, the question was, "How can I design a chess set that is uniform, visually balanced, and pleasant to play with?" Further on, the question became, "What can I change in my code to best fabricate my design?" Throughout, I aimed to combine the sciences (psych, manu, ...) with the fundementals of art (form, texture, color, etc.)</p>
        <h3>Development through Practice, Experimentation, and Revision</h3>
        <p>I had to fix the code whenever the machine erred. The kings' hats broke (image 7); the lathe tools shook when cutting the rooks' heads (img. 8), the pawns slid and created an offset (img. 9). Most often, the solution was the cut slower/shallower. The knight (imgs. 12-13) had the most evolution: a) First try had a large offset. b) I tried to smooth the transition with deeper cuts, which I used in the end, but first I had to c) fix the offset. d) I tried adding detail by sharpening the muzzle, and e) switched to a round tool (img. 11) to reduce sharp angles. Finally, I f) fixed a tool problem.</p>
        <h3>Image 1</h3>
        <img id="SI1" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 1.png" alt="An initial sketch of chess pieces, including the king, rook, bishop, and pawn. Each piece is only the right half, since they are symmetrical, and has measurements. They all have the same measurements for their bases.">
        <p>Initial design. Unified all with the same base, and the knight, bishop, rook with the same height.</p>
        <h3>Image 2</h3>
        <img id="SI2" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 2.png" alt="A photo of a CNC lathe. It has a screen with a lot of buttons on the right and a large sliding door. The inside is unable to be seen.">
        <p>Haas ST10. Learning how the lathe works. Over time, I learned its sounds, rhythms, etc., which helped me catch errors.</p>
        <h3>Image 3</h3>
        <img id="SI3" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 3.png" alt="The chess piece designs have been loaded into Fusion 360, a 3D modeling program. However, only one half of each 2D silhouette is visible. The measurements are also visible. The parts have been constructed with rectangles and circles. ">
        <p>Fusion 360. Final designs (sans knight). Used circles to get the side-curves. Adjusted bishop and rooks' thickness.</p>
        <h3>Image 4</h3>
        <img id="SI4" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 4.png" alt="A screenshot of Fusion 360. The silhouettes have been rotated around an axis to produce 3D forms. The first set of pieces is blocky with sharp edges, the second set is more rounded. For the first time, the knight appears--the geometric torso and head of a horse on top of a base that matches the other pieces.">
        <p>Fusion 360. Smoothing the sharp edges to protect chess players' fingers; scultping the knight.</p>
        <h3>Image 5</h3>
        <img id="SI5" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 5.png" alt="Screenshots from Fusion 360. The toolpath, or coded movement of the cutting tool, is being rendered and simulated. A line traces the toolpath. Two more screenshots are pulled from a timelapse, where the pawn is color-coded depending on if there is too much or too little material left after cutting.">
        <p>Fusion 360. Coding each part. Most revisions were changing cutting speeds or tools.</p>
        <h3>Image 6</h3>
        <img id="SI6" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 6.png" alt="A photo of the inside of the lathe. A cylinder of aluminum called stock sits in a chuck, which will spin rapidly when the lathe is turned on. The various cutting tools sit at the ready, ready to move into the spinning stock. Chips from previous operations blanket the base of the lathe.">
        <p>Re-calibrating tool setup after discovering issues.</p>
        <h3>Image 7</h3>
        <img id="SI7" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 7.png" alt="Two king pieces. Both have a topper to differentiate from the queens. The king on the left’s topper is chipped and ruined, the one on the right is perfect.">
        <p>Each is 3.5 in tall with a diameter of 1.5 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted the code to prevent chipping.</p>
        <h3>Image 8</h3>
        <img id="SI8" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 8.png" alt="Three pawns. The first is disfigured, with random cuts and a sharp piece of scrap metal attached to its middle. The second pawn moved while cutting, which left the spherical head as an oval, among other flaws. The one on the right is perfect.">
        <p>Each is 2.25 in tall with a diameter of 1 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted the code and position of "stock" (aka unfinished material) to increase consistency.</p>
        <h3>Image 9</h3>
        <img id="SI9" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 9.png" alt="Three rooks. The first two have rough, textured sides and disfigured bases. The third is smooth and has the correct base.">
        <p>Each is 2.75 in tall with a diameter of 1.25 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted code and position of stock to prevent the rough texture of "chatter" (when the tool shakes as it cuts)</p>
        <h3>Image 10</h3>
        <img id="SI10" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 10.png" alt="Five bishops. The three on the left have various problems, such as chips, elongation, or incorrect bases. The two on the left are identical.">
        <p>Each is 2.75 in tall with a diameter of 1.25 in, made of aluminum. I selected pieces with the most uniformity (especially in the bases and tops) (uniform on the right)</p>
        <h3>Image 11</h3>
        <img id="SI11" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 11.png" alt="Screenshots of Fusion 360. The first image shows the silhouette of the knight as it would be cut by the first lathe--it looks like a cylinder with grooves. The second image shows a flat drill carving out the face of the knight. Here, it looks more like a horse, as the sides have been cut flat and the front has been carved out. The third image uses a drill with a rounded tip, which allows the end product to be round and safer to use.">
        <p>Fusion 360. "Live tooling" to get the profile. Switched to a rounded drill to allow curved edges.</p>
        <h3>Image 12 and 13</h3>
        <img id="SI12" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 12.png" alt="Two photos of six knight pieces. The first pieces have extreme mistakes, with the two sides offset by a considerable amount. The third knight is aligned correctly, but it is flat and not detailed. The last three become gradually more detailed and rounded.">
        <img id="SI13" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 13.png">
        <p>Each is 2.75 in tall with a diameter of 1.25 in, made of aluminum. I adjusted machine offsets until the halves met, then added details.</p>
        <h3>Image 14 and 15</h3>
        <img id="SI14" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 14.png" alt="An overhead photo of the complete chess set, on a chess board. One half has the heads of the pieces colored with black acrylic paint.">
        <img id="SI15" onclick="yeet(this)" src="AP Portfolio Photos/SI 15.png" alt="A closer picture of the chess set">
        <p>Total height: 4.13 in. Total width/depth: 19 in. Materials: aluminum, acrylic paint, felt, and a wooden chess board. I painted one half of the set black and added felt feet.</p>
