      <h2>Written Evidence - Sustained Investigation</h2>
      <h3>Inquiry</h3>
      <p>How can I combine manufacturing and art? I have a long history of combining STEM and the humanities; during this project I wanted to incorporate both to create a beautiful end product. By changing the manufacturing steps, I could reach my artistic vision. At the beginning, the question was, "How can I design a chess set that is uniform, visually balanced, and pleasant to play with?" Further on, the question became, "What can I change in my code to best fabricate my design?" Throughout, I aimed to combine the sciences (psych, manu, ...) with the fundementals of art (form, texture, color, etc.)</p>
      <h3>Development through Practice, Experimentation, and Revision</h3>
      <p>I had to fix the code whenever the machine erred. The kings' hats broke (figure 7); the lathe tools shook when cutting the rooks' heads (fig. 8), the pawns slid and created an offset (fig. 9). Most often, the solution was the cut slower/shallower. The knight (figs. 12-13) had the most evolution: a) First try had a large offset. b) I tried to smooth the transition with deeper cuts, which I used in the end, but first I had to c) fix the offset. d) I tried adding detail by sharpening the muzzle, and e) switched to a round tool (fig. 11) to reduce sharp angles. Finally, I f) fixed a tool problem.</p>
