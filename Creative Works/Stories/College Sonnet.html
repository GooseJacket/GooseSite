<b>Odysseus, Class of 2024.</b>
<br>The sunlight bled in loose-leaf prison bars,
<br>Calypso’s laughter as he choked in fear,
<br>Pigs Circe funded promised he’ll go far,
<br>Yet dreams crunch underfoot after a year.
<br>He bore tsunamis, fatal errors, all;
<br>His Ikarus friends lost their grips on boughs,
<br>‘Till Nobody knew who he was. A call
<br>To Ithaca helped him corral his sows,
<br>Pens stark on white, a bud to bloom--Alas!
<br>Colossal wrecks of piggies, bare of gold!
<br>Penelope watched dust fall from his grasp;
<br>This fruitless, lost Pygmalion was told:
<br>“With deep regret, we don’t have space for you,
<br>Too many talented have filled our queue.”
