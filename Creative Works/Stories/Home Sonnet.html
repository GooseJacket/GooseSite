<b>Ode to Home</b>
<br>Spaghetti, witch’s cauldron bubbling;
<br>toast: avocado, butter-slathered; chop'd
<br>charcuterie arranged in fairy rings;
<br>steam hissing, rice a snowy mountain top.
<br>A coffee mug awaits you when you wake;
<br>the queen’s enchanted words a waterfall; 
<br>you fetch tea-refills at commercial breaks;
<br>the songs and laughter echo through the walls.
<br>A purring cat, your lap his throne, regards
<br>the sentinel, the dragon’s blanket hoard,
<br>the gluttonous inhaler, in the yard
<br>four bowing petticoats before their lord.
<br>This kingdom’s fortune, not’riety
<br>For stealing time away society.
