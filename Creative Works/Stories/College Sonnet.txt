Odysseus, Class of 2024.
The sunlight bled in loose-leaf prison bars,
Calypso’s laughter as he choked in fear,
Pigs Circe funded promised he’ll go far,
Yet dreams crunch underfoot after a year.
He bore tsunamis, fatal errors, all;
His Ikarus friends lost their grips on boughs,
‘Till Nobody knew who he was. A call
To Ithaca helped him corral his sows,
Pens stark on white, a bud to bloom--Alas!
Colossal wrecks of piggies, bare of gold!
Penelope watched dust fall from his grasp;
This fruitless, lost Pygmalion was told:
“With deep regret, we don’t have space for you,
Too many talented have filled our queue.”
