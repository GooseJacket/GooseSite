hey can you pmu 🥺 🙏
The car is waiting
and the bass rumbles the road for a ten-foot radius
you pick up your feet swing your backpack in front hop into the passenger seat
buckle click
He’s singing along to some hip hop or rap song you don’t know
but it’s nice and your heart thumps along to the rhythms beneath the lyrics
as you apologize for being late
volume up
The song changes but you know this one so a grin splits across your face
and you scream along, can’t hear yourself over the volume
and he’s belting too and you did something right for once
changing gear
The sun filtering through the windshield blinds you
and your back aches and your legs groan and your friend hurt your feelings
but you can feel the music echoing through your body and you’re smiling
turn signal
He pulls up at the store and joy swims in your stomach
jump out of the car jog to catch up duck into the air conditioning
instead of beelining to the counter he ambles around
tips & tastes
He doesn’t know how coffee pods work
and you laugh so hard your sides hurt and strangers turn to you in concern
but he’s smirking and you grin back and it hurts in a good way
checkout line
You get a cinnamon pretzel, warm and sweet and comforting like a hug,
and he complains that they changed the drinks again 
as he fills his cup with your terrible suggestion of raspberry tea-cola-limeade
exit only
When you get home there’s a great song that neither of you can pause
so you sit in the driveway and shout the lyrics for five minutes
until he turns off the car on the last note and you hop out
cross threshold
and you don’t see him the rest of the day.
