<b>hey can you pmu 🥺 🙏</b>
<br>The car is waiting
<br>and the bass rumbles the road for a ten-foot radius
<br>you pick up your feet swing your backpack in front hop into the passenger seat
<br><i>buckle click</i>
<br>He’s singing along to some hip hop or rap song you don’t know
<br>but it’s nice and your heart thumps along to the rhythms beneath the lyrics
<br>as you apologize for being late
<br><i>volume up</i>
<br>The song changes but you know this one so a grin splits across your face
<br>and you scream along, can’t hear yourself over the volume
<br>and he’s belting too and you did something right for once
<br><i>changing gear</i>
<br>The sun filtering through the windshield blinds you
<br>and your back aches and your legs groan and your friend hurt your feelings
<br>but you can feel the music echoing through your body and you’re smiling
<br><i>turn signal</i>
<br>He pulls up at the store and joy swims in your stomach
<br>jump out of the car jog to catch up duck into the air conditioning
<br>instead of beelining to the counter he ambles around
<br><i>tips & tastes</i>
<br>He doesn’t know how coffee pods work
<br>and you laugh so hard your sides hurt and strangers turn to you in concern
<br>but he’s smirking and you grin back and it hurts in a good way
<br><i>checkout line</i>
<br>You get a cinnamon pretzel, warm and sweet and comforting like a hug,
<br>and he complains that they changed the drinks again 
<br>as he fills his cup with your terrible suggestion of raspberry tea-cola-limeade
<br><i>exit only</i>
<br>When you get home there’s a great song that neither of you can pause
<br>so you sit in the driveway and shout the lyrics for five minutes
<br>until he turns off the car on the last note and you hop out
<br><i>cross threshold</i>
<br>and you don’t see him the rest of the day.
