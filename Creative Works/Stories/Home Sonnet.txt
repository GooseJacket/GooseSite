Ode to Home
Spaghetti, witch’s cauldron bubbling;
toast: avocado, butter-slathered; chop'd
charcuterie arranged in fairy rings;
steam hissing, rice a snowy mountain top.
A coffee mug awaits you when you wake;
the queen’s enchanted words a waterfall; 
you fetch tea-refills at commercial breaks;
the songs and laughter echo through the walls.
A purring cat, your lap his throne, regards
the sentinel, the dragon’s blanket hoard,
the gluttonous inhaler, in the yard
four bowing petticoats before their lord.
This kingdom’s fortune, not’riety
For stealing time away society.
