When you hear that a student was “suspended for threatening the principal’s life”, what comes to your mind?
</br></br>
Probably a tall teenager, a leather jacket. His face is marred with bruises and a scowl, and he skips school on the daily. 
The last thing that would come to your mind would be a 4’ 9”, straight-A teacher’s pet. With hair pulled into neat braids and dozens of books devoured weekly, I was a fifth grade suspendee. 
</br></br>
It all started with the new principal, Miss Georgia. The day she arrived, she vowed: "I will improve this school. I cannot wait to get to know each and every one of you."
I, ten years old and not yet jaded by politicians, believed her. I greeted Miss Georgia happily every time we passed in the hallways. 
But, to my dismay, even by October, recognition never flashed across her eyes. She didn’t even know my name. Getting to know us was not on her priority list--what else had she lied about? She surely wasn’t bettering the school--it was getting worse!
The continued lack of bathroom supplies? The nonexistent or nonfunctional water fountains? Miss Georgia was the villain who had arranged all of these issues.
I snapped. I wrote my list of grievances and emailed it to her “anonymously”.
</br></br>
This is where I made my fatal mistake. In 2016, America was haunted by clowns. Paranoia about villainous clowns swept the nation.
So, to add weight to my words, I signed off with, "PS: I hope the clowns get you."
</br></br>
The next day, Miss Georgia pulled me out of class, steaming mad--but, suddenly, she knew my name! 
Ang, how could you do this? Ang, I expected better from you!
It turned out, the clowns were said to have killed people, which meant I had technically threatened her life. I didn’t want her to die, I just wanted her to take me seriously! 
</br></br>
Miserably sitting at home that day, something in me died. To protest, to speak up, meant being ignored and punished.
So I didn't rock the boat. For years. I stuck steadfast to the most trivial rules. You might call it accountability--but it really was just paralyzing anxiety. 
</br></br>
Did I deserve this trauma for a sentence that I didn’t even mean? I admit, even mentioning nonlethal clowns was wrong--but I was ten. Kids make mistakes. It was a missed opportunity to build a dialogue and solve the issues that only the students could see. Children don't whine, they react. Don't brush them aside--their feelings are just as valid as adults.
</br></br>
These days, I'm regaining my voice. I email my councilmembers and principal every inequity I find. My tone is sickeningly sweet, so the worst thing that they can do is say nothing will change.
Speak up. Your manager, president don't have the view that you do. If something is fundamentally wrong, tell the people who can change it.
</br></br>
After all, it’s America, the land of free speech. What's the worst thing they can do, suspend you?</p>
